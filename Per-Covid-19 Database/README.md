The slices are available in 'Database1.zip' file, are the labels are available in 'Database\_new.xlsx' file. The columns of the '.xlsx' file represent: the image name, the Covid-19 infection percentage, the fold split and the subject id, respectively.
The above link contains the original dataset, where the lung regions were cropped manually.   

The dataset was enhanced and used for Covid-19-Infection-Percentage-Estimation-Challenge (the original dataset was preprocessed by cropping the lung regions, while in the challenge we provided the original slices images), and more Ct-scans were added.
