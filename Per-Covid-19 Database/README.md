The slices are available in 'Database1.zip' file, are the labels are available in 'Database\_new.xlsx' file. The columns of the '.xlsx' file represent: the image name, the Covid-19 infection percentage, the fold split and the subject id, respectively.
The above link contains the original dataset, where the lung regions were cropped manually.   

Actually, this dataset was enhanced and used for the challenge (the original dataset was preprocessed by cropping the lung regions, while in the challenge we provided the original slices images), and more Ct-scans were added.

Unfortunately, the registration for the challenge ended.
But you can use Codalab to compare your results with other teams, for the challenge there is an extra testing dataset, if you got a result better than the best 10 approaches, you can send us your predictions and we can provide you the testing results
